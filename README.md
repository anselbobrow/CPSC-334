# CPSC-334
## About
This repo is an archive of the projects created for [@scotterikpetersen](https://github.com/scottericpetersen)'s course Creative Embedded Systems (CPSC 334) at Yale during the fall 2022 semester. The course is divided into modules that focus on different mechanics of the embedded devices at our disposal in the context of installation art and other creative uses.

## Usage
### `mxtx/`
The course is divided into modules and tasks, whose code can be found in the corresponding subdirectory (i.e. `m1t2/`). Task 1 for each module is a purely technical exercise, while Task 2 is a project based creative application using the knowledge from Task 1 (and building on prior modules). The code used in the projects can be found in each project directory. Techincal instructions and tips for recreating the projects are found in the READMEs. Additionally, a breakdown of my experience and inspiration for creating the projects can be found in the associated blog post for each project, copied from Notion to a markdown file named `blog_post.md` in each project directory.

### `labx/`
Directories labeled `labx/` store the code written during that lab, as well as lab notes that describe useful findings and resources used in the lab. These labs often serve as the foundation for a subsequent Task 1, so most or all of the code may be the same in some cases.

### `raspi/`
This directory stores config files and dotfiles for the Raspberry Pi. The Pi used in this class was a Pi 4 model B with 4GB RAM. Files in this directory are universal to the course, Pi setup specific to projects (installing necessary libraries or software, running on boot, etc.) can be found in the individual project directories.
