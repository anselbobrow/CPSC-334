# CPSC-334
## About
This repo is an archive of the projects created for Scott Petersen's course Creative Embedded Systems (CPSC 334) at Yale during the fall 2022 semester. The course is divided into modules that focus on different mechanics of the embedded devices at our disposal in the context of installation art and other creative uses.

## Usage
The code for each module can be found in the corresponding subdirectory. Task 1 is a purely technical exercise, while Task 2 is a project based creative application using the knowledge from Task 1 (and building on prior modules). The code used in the projects can be found in each project directory. Techincal instructions and tips for recreating the projects are found in the READMEs. Additionally, a breakdown of my experience and inspiration for creating the projects can be found in the associated blog post for each project, copied from Notion to a markdown file named `blog_post.md` in each project directory.
